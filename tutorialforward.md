# Forward calculation

Here, synthetic calculation of travel-times is performed to practice handling SeaGap.

You first prepare an underwater sound profile ("ss\_prof.inp": See [Dataformat](/dataformat/)).

\$ head ss\_prof.inp

```plaintext
0.00 1526.998
5.00 1529.598
10.00 1529.594
15.00 1529.637
20.00 1529.684
25.00 1529.748
30.00 1529.343
35.00 1528.586
40.00 1527.722
45.00 1525.194
```

SeaGap prepares the read function for "ss\_prof.inp" `read_prof(fn,TR_DEPTH)`.
`fn` is the file name (such as `fn="ss_prof.inp"`).
`TR_DEPTH` is the depth of the sea-surface transponder from the sea-surface.
Although `TR_DEPTH` changes depending on attitudes of the sea-surface platform, it is enough to roughly provide its average value.
This value is used for identifying which sound speed layer of "ss\_prof.inp" the transducer exists.

```julia
TR_DEPTH = 3.0
z, v, nz_st, numz = SeaGap.read_prof("ss_prof.inp",TR_DEPTH)
```

Performing the above (`TR_DEPTH` is set as 3.0), you obtain `z` (depth value vector), `v` (velocity value vector), `nz_st` (number of layer that the transducer exists), and `numz` (total number of layers). 

Next, you should obtain a local Earth radius. Using `localradius(lat)`, you can obtain a Gaussian mean radius and a local mean radius ([Chadwell & Sweeney, 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490419.2010.492283)).
They do not show significant difference for calculating a travel-time; therefore, SeaGap generally uses the Gaussian mean radius. 

For tha case `lat=38.0`,
```julia
Rg, Rl = SeaGap.localradius(38.0)
(6.372923169901545e6, 6.372909276228537e6)
```
`Rg` is the Gaussian mean radius, and `Rl` is the local mean radius.

Then, you can calculate one-way exact travel-times (see [Methodology](/methodtt/)) by `xyz2tt(px,py,pz,xd,yd,zd,z,v,nz_st,numz,Rg,TR_DEPTH)` where `px`, `py`, and `pz` are position of a seafloor transponder, and `xd`, `yd`, and `zd` are position of a sea-surface transducer.
Unit of these positions is meter.

```julia
px = 1500.0; py = 0.0; pz = -3000.0
xd = 100.0; yd = -100.0; zd = -1.5 
tc, Nint, vert = SeaGap.xyz2tt(px,py,pz,xd,yd,zd,z,v,nz_st,numz,Rg,TR_DEPTH)
(2.220777604567047, 4, 0.9057269733438277)
```

`tc` is the one-way travel-time, `Nint` is the total number of iterations in the shooting method, and vert is the normalizing factor corresponding to $\frac{1}{M}$ shown in [Methodlogy](/methodkinematic/).

If you'd like to calculate the approximate travel-time (see [Methodology](/methodtt/)), you have to run `ttcorrection(px,py,pz,tr_height,z,v,nz_st,numz,TR_DEPTH,lat)` in advance.
Then, you can calculate the approximate travel-time by `xyz2tt_rapid()`

```julia
tr_height = -1.0
Tv0, Vd, Vr, cc, rms = SeaGap.ttcorrection(px,py,pz,tr_height,z,v,nz_st,numz,TR_DEPTH,lat)
```

You have to provide `tr_height` which is the mean height of the sea-surface transponder; if you have time-series of the sea-surface transponder height as `zd`, `tr_height=Statistics.mean(zd)`.
But, note that rough value is acceptable for `tr_height` within a few meters. 

`Tv0`, `Vd`, `Vr`, and `cc` is correction paramters for performing `xyz2tt_rapid()`.`rms` is RMS between the exact and the approximate travel-times when optimizing. 

Then, `xyz2tt_rapid()` can be performed as following:
```julia
tc_r, to_r, vert_r = SeaGap.xyz2tt_rapid(px,py,pz,xd,yd,zd,Rg,Tv0,Vd,Vr,tr_height,cc)
(2.2207776042517358, 2.2207913746628574, 0.9057269733438277)
```

`tc_r` is the approximate travel-time,`to_r` is the simple spherical travel-time ($T_{\rm Sphere}$), and `vert_r` is the same with `vert`.

Moreover, SeaGap equips another function to calculate the approximate travel-time: `xyz2ttg_rapid()`.

```julia
tc_g, vert_g, hh_x, hh_y = SeaGap.xyz2ttg_rapid(px,py,pz,xd,yd,zd,Rg,Tv0,Vd,Vr,tr_height,cc)
(2.2207776042517358, 0.9057269733438277, 0.4669001167250292, 0.03335000833750208)
```

`tc_g` and `vert_g` are same with `tc_r` and `vert_r`, respectively. `hh_x` and `hh_y` are coefficients for expressing a deep gradient (See [Methodology](/methodmcmcpvg/)).

If you'd like to obtain travel-times from various sea-surface points, you can do it like:
```julia
  xdv = Float64[]; ydv = Float64[]; zdv = Float64[]; tcv = Float64[]
  yd = 0.
  for xd in 0:100:2000
    # --- Set z-value randomly from -5 to 0
    zd = rand()*-5.0
    # --- Calculate TT
    tc, Nint, vert = xyz2tt(px,py,pz,xd,yd,zd,z,v,nz_st,numz,Rg,TR_DEPTH)
    push!(xdv,xd); push!(ydv,yd); push!(zdv,zd); push!(tcv,tc)
  end 
```

Then, you can obtain as:
```julia
 hcat(xdv,ydv,zdv,tcv)
21Ã—4 Matrix{Float64}:
    0.0  0.0  -0.961723  2.24927

 2000.0  0.0  -1.55564   2.03915
```

You can test the above calculation by `forward_test(lat,TR_DEPTH,pos,fn="ss_prof.inp")` with `pos` is a position vector of a seafloor trannsponder `pos = [px,py,pz]`.

```julia
xdv, ydv, zdv, tcv = SeaGap.forward_test(lat,TR_DEPTH,[px,py,pz],fn="ss_prof.inp")

using Plots # Drawing figure
plot(xdv,tcv)
```

You can check how the travel-times vary depending on the horizontal distance by the plotted figure.
The horizontal axis indicates the horizontal distance in meter, and the vertical axis indicates the calculated travel-times in sec.
